The processing of the experimental data and generation of the numerical data is provided in the folder "Data". "Gaussian.ipynb", "Lognormal.ipynb" and "Experimental.ipynb" contain the training of the ANNs performing parameter estimation tasks, and the calculation of Fisher information inside the layers the ANNs.

The purpose of this repository is only to provide an exemplary implementation.

The experimental data set is stored at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17021436. When run locally, the file "Data1.npz" from the repository should be placed in the folder "Data".
